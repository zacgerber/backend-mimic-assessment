# Mimic 

In this assignment, you will use your knowledge of file reading, looping, and list and dictionary manipulation to map the words from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and produce a cryptic, jumbled version of your own.

## Part A
Build a "mimic" dict that maps each word that appears in the [alice.txt](./alice.txt) file to a list of all the words that immediately follow that word in the file. The list of words can be in any order and should include duplicates. For example, the key `"and"` might have the list `["then", "best", "then", "after", ...]` listing all the words which came after "and" in the entire text.

For development, use the short [imdev.txt](./imdev.txt) file. When your mimic dictionary is created from this file, it should look like this when printed:
```python
{
    '' : ['I']
    'a' : ['software']
    'and' : ['I']
    'developer,' : ['and']
    'don't' : ['care']
    'I' : ['am', "don't"]
    'who' : ['knows"']
    'am' : ['a']
    'care' : ['who']
    'software' : ['developer,']
}
```
Notice that the first entry in the dictionary above is the empty string `""`.  Since we are creating a dictionary of "next word" lists, it implies that there exists a previous word key for each next-list value.  This, of course, is true except in the case of the first entry of the dictionary. Use the empty string as a seed for the first entry.

## Part B
Output your own jumbled version of the story!

With the mimic dict created, it's fairly easy to emit random text that mimics the original. Print a word, then look up what words might come next and pick one at random as the next word.

## Sample Output, using alice.txt as input
```console

"Edwin and she came a child!' said the Gryphon: and all round it, and sharks are all over the King replied. `Yes, please do!' said nothing. `When I'M a whisper, half no right distance--but then Alice, and it. She went on, three weeks!' `I'm glad there seemed to sing this:-- `Fury said Alice, and she had to see Shakespeare, in her hands at the Gryphon, and, last word with a minute or other; but he had gone down off staring at the Cat, she began: `O Mouse, do next!

She was gone, and there was in a few minutes, and tumbled head first, and look at the words
